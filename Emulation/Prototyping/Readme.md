# Prototype Something Something Dark Side
Collection of Info and Sketches for Prototyping PIM Emulation 

Mostly just 'Proof of Concept' and early thought processes  

It is not recomended to use any of this in a final product - only as a jumping off point


## SpeedoDrive-V1.ino
    Currently Testing on Arduino Uno R3
    Plan is to use a ATMega328P. 
    Still to develop KPH speed input.
    
    Tests Good - small discrepencies in speed.
    Input       Speedo Value.
    100 KPH      99 KPH.
     90 KPH      89 KPH.
     50 KPH      50 KPH.
     20 KPH      20 KPH.
     10 KPH      11 KPH.
      5 KPH       3 KPH.

## SpeedoDrive-V2.ino
     Almost the same as V1
     
     Mainly start tidying code and adding lots of useful comments
